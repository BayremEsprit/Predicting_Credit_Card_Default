## Classification Algorithm Comparison Project

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of various classification algorithms for solving a binary classification problem. The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Understanding and Visualization:** Utilize the Pandas library to gain insights from the data and create informative graphs.

2. **Data Preparation:** Cleanse the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing normalization where required.

3. **Feature Selection:** Identify the most relevant features to optimize model performance.

4. **Testing 8 Classification Algorithms:** Test eight different classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network to solve the binary classification problem.

5. **Parameter Tuning:** Optimize algorithm parameters to achieve the best results for each model.

6. **Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:** Generate confusion matrices and display classification reports for each algorithm. This helps assess precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

7. **Selecting the Best Algorithm:** Utilize classification reports to choose the algorithm that exhibits the best performance in solving the classification problem.

8. **ROC Curves and AUC Calculation:** Plot ROC curves and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each algorithm to assess their ability to distinguish between classes.

## Dependencies

The project uses several Python libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more. Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the code.

## Results and Findings

After analyzing and comparing the performance of various classification algorithms, we will be able to identify the best-suited algorithm for solving our specific binary classification problem. The evaluation metrics, such as classification reports and AUC values, will provide insights into each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.
